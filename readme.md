## Pushups!

### Aggregate your pushups workouts and predict when you will reach the goal of 10000 pushups!

Created with :heart: in Rust!

This project uses serde-json, as well as clippy. Set your rust version to nightly:
`rustup default nightly`
or if you don't want to change the rust's version globally, inside the project's main directory:
`rustup override set nightly` (this will use nightly version only for this project).

Build with `cargo build --release --features "clippy"` (this will use clippy).
